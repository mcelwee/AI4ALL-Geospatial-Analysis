    "## According to a 2010 report made by the US Federal Aviation Administration, the economic price of domestic flight delays entails a yearly cost of 32.9 billion dollars to passengers, airlines and other parts of the economy. More than half of that amount comes from the pockets of passengers who not only lose time waiting for their planes to leave, but they also miss connecting flights, spend money on food and have to sleep on hotel rooms while they're stranded. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The report, focusing on data from year 2007, estimated that air transportation delays put a 4 billion dollar dent in the country's gross domestic product that year. Full report can be found [here](http://www.isr.umd.edu/NEXTOR/pubs/TDI_Report_Final_10_18_10_V3.pdf).\n",
